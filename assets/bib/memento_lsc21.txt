abstract = {In this paper, we introduce a new lifelog retrieval system called Memento that leverages semantic representations of images and textual queries projected into a common latent space to facilitate effective retrieval. It bridges the semantic gap between complex visual scenes/events and user information needs expressed as textual and faceted queries. The system, developed for the 2021 Lifelog Search Challenge, also has a minimalist user interface that includes primary search, temporal search, and visual data filtering components.},
